### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    temperature_unit: "C"
    temp_step: 0.5
    min_temp: "5"
    max_temp: "30"
    current_temperature_topic: true
    current_temperature_template: "{{ value_json.local_temperature }}"
    mode_state_topic: true
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json.system_mode }}"
    modes: 
      - "off"
      - "auto"
      - "heat"
    mode_command_topic: true
    action_topic: true
    action_template: "{% set values = {'idle':'off','heat':'heating','cool':'cooling','fan only':'fan'} %}{{ values[value_json.running_state] }}"
    temperature_command_topic: "current_heating_setpoint"
    temperature_state_template: "{{ value_json.current_heating_setpoint }}"
    temperature_state_topic: true

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
