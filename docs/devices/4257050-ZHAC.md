## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.



## Exposes
### Light 
TODO

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get` with payload `{"voltage": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Current (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current.
Value can be found in the published state on the `current` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get` with payload `{"current": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
