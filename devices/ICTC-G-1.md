## Notes


### Pairing
To factory reset the TRADFRI wireless dimmer (ICTC-G-1) press the button
4 times (so the red lights starts blinking).
After the blinks you migth be willing to rotate the dimmer
like you are trying to control your lights. It will prevent the device
from going to sleep and ensure successful paiting. In case the dimmer was
recognized but no actions seems to be detected, try to restart the zigbee2mqtt.
