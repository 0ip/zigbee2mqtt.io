## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb see
[HOWTO: Factory reset a Hue bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

This may also be possible with the
[Tradfri Remote Control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/tradfri-remote-control__0489469_PE623665_S4.JPG)
by pressing and holding the reset button on the bottom of the remote (next to the battery).
[This may not always work](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/296#issuecomment-416923751).
