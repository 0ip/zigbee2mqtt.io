## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold the reset button on the device for +- 5 seconds (until the blue light starts blinking).

**IMPORTANT**: Release and start pressing the reset button every second.
This keeps the device awake, otherwise pairing will **fail!**.

*NOTE: When you fail to pair a device, try replacing the battery, this could solve the problem.*
